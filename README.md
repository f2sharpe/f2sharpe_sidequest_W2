## Description

Code adds platforms and draws a blob taken from example code, and this new iteration changes the blob to have an excited emotion, speeding up the rate of the animation to have the blob seem restless, and eagar to get moving, or excited to get moving.

## Learning Goals

Learning Goals:

Learn how to look at code and decide what the best course of action may be to change and look at it. I'd say an outcome of this speicifc assignment as someone who has a lot of experience with code is that sometimes the smallest changes can make a big difference in how an object comes across.
